Figures are generated using following scripts:
fig1c,fig1d - data generated by hs_iter_grid_2rooms_formedW.txt 
fig1f,fig2 - data generated by KLs_reg_iter_valiter_grid_formedWCopies.txt 
fig1f,alpha=0&beta=0 - data generated by KLs_R_valiterCopies.txt 
Schematics fig1a,b,e and fig3 are plotted manually

To run a script, one need python installed, and run the command line: 

python filename.txt 

with the respective filename.

Python should be installed before, including following used packages: numpy, cv2, PIL. Also, for generating videos ghostscript should be installed, and the path to the ghostscript exe file (gswin64.exe) should be set to the variable EpsImagePlugin.gs_windows_binary


Simulations were performed on a laptop with a processor Intel Core i7-10750H CPU, 2.6 GHz, 6 Cores, with 32Gb RAM
